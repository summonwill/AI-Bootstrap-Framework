## 🚀 What is AI Bootstrap Framework?

AI Bootstrap Framework is an open-source governance system for AI-assisted development. It provides deterministic, auditable workflows that prevent common AI coding pitfalls while enabling safe automation at scale.

**Works with ANY AI assistant** - from browser-based ChatGPT to IDE-integrated GitHub Copilot.

**Key Features:**
- 🔒 **Governance-First Architecture** - Built-in safety checks and audit trails
- 🎯 **Determinism Testing** - Verify AI outputs are consistent and reliable
- 📋 **Session Management** - Persistent state across AI interactions
- ⚠️ **Risk Classification** - Automatic detection of high-risk changes
- 🔍 **Multi-Mind Verification** - Internal validation before execution
- 📊 **Structured Logging** - Complete audit trail for compliance
- 📱 **Universal Access** - Works in browser, mobile, and IDE equally well

---

## 🎯 Why AI Bootstrap?

AI coding assistants are powerful but unpredictable. They can:
- Generate inconsistent outputs from identical prompts
- Delete files unintentionally
- Make unauthorized changes to critical code
- Lack persistent memory across sessions

**AI Bootstrap Framework solves these problems** by providing:
- Deterministic behavior through governance rules
- Safety mechanisms for high-risk operations
- Session continuity with persistent state files
- Audit trails for compliance and debugging
- **Platform independence** - same governance everywhere

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

The framework is built on three core principles:

### 1. Boot Protocol
Every AI interaction starts with a deterministic boot sequence that loads:
- Project context and constraints
- Session history and state
- Active tasks and priorities
- Safety rules and risk classifications

### 2. Persistent State
Long-lived memory stored in project files:
- `SESSION_NOTES.md` - Chronological work log
- `TODO.md` - Task registry and progress
- `AI_CONTEXT_INDEX.md` - Project structure map
- `AI_RULES_AND_BEST_PRACTICES.md` - Governance rules

### 3. Multi-Mind Verification
Critical changes undergo internal validation:
- **Builder** - Proposes the solution
- **Critic** - Identifies flaws and risks
- **Spec Guardian** - Validates against requirements

---

## 📦 What's Included

This repository contains:

- **`AI_RULES_AND_BEST_PRACTICES.md`** - The core governance framework
- **Documentation** - Complete guides for implementation
- **Examples** - Sample projects using the framework
- **CLI Tools** - *(Coming Soon)* Command-line governance enforcement
- **GitHub Action** - *(Coming Soon)* Automated PR governance checks

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 🌐 For Browser/Mobile Users (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)

**The fastest way to get started - zero installation required!**

1. **Download the framework file:**
   - Click [`AI_RULES_AND_BEST_PRACTICES.md`](AI_RULES_AND_BEST_PRACTICES.md) and download it
   
2. **Upload to your preferred LLM:**
   - Open ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini
   - Upload the `AI_RULES_AND_BEST_PRACTICES.md` file
   - Say: "Please bootstrap governance for my project"

3. **Download generated files:**
   - AI will generate `SESSION_NOTES.md`, `TODO.md`, `AI_CONTEXT_INDEX.md`
   - Download all files as artifacts
   - Commit them to your repository

4. **Continue working:**
   - Next session: Upload ALL 4 files to reconstruct context
   - Work on your project with full governance
   - Download updated files at session end and commit

**Mobile workflow:** Use GitHub mobile app + ChatGPT/Claude mobile app for on-the-go governed development!

### 💻 For IDE Users (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf)

1. **Add the governance framework to your project:**
   ```bash
   # Clone this repository
   git clone https://github.com/summonwill/ai-bootstrap-framework.git
   
   # Copy core file to your project
   cp ai-bootstrap-framework/AI_RULES_AND_BEST_PRACTICES.md your-project/
   ```

2. **Let your AI assistant bootstrap:**
   - Your IDE AI (GitHub Copilot, etc.) will read the file
   - It will auto-generate `SESSION_NOTES.md`, `TODO.md`, `AI_CONTEXT_INDEX.md`
   - All files are created directly in your file system

3. **Start working:**
   - AI assistant follows governance automatically
   - Session notes and TODO update after each change
   - Enable multi-mind verification for critical operations

### For Teams

Professional and Enterprise tiers offer:
- CLI enforcement tools (`abs check`, `abs determinism`)
- GitHub Action for automated PR governance
- Governed project starter templates
- Centralized reporting and analytics
- SSO and team management

## 🌟 Why "Bootstrap"?

Just as a computer needs a boot protocol to initialize reliably, AI assistants need a bootstrap process to behave deterministically. This framework provides that boot protocol - a reset vector that ensures consistent, safe, and auditable AI behavior across sessions.

## 📊 Status

**Current Version:** Pre-release (under active development)  
**CLI Release:** Week 8 (Target: Early 2026)  
**Production Ready:** Q1 2026

⭐ **Star this repository to follow development progress!**
