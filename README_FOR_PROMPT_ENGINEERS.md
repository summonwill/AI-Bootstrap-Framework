# How to Use This Governance Framework
## A Practical Guide for Prompt Engineers

This document explains how to use the AI Bootstrap Framework in your projects as a prompt engineer, whether you're working in an IDE (like VS Code) or a browser/mobile chat (like ChatGPT or Claude).

---

## 🎯 What This Framework Does

The AI Bootstrap Framework gives AI assistants a "memory" and "operating system" so they can:
- Remember what they did in previous sessions
- Track tasks and priorities
- Follow consistent rules across projects
- Generate governance files automatically

Instead of retyping context every session, you upload a few files and the AI reconstructs your entire project state.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start: Your First Session

### Option 1: Using ChatGPT (Browser or Mobile)

**Step 1:** Copy this prompt:

```
You are an AI agent working in a governed project.

I am uploading AI_RULES_AND_BEST_PRACTICES.md - treat this as the binding operating system for all work.

This is a **new project** with no governance files yet.

Follow these steps automatically:

1. Read AI_RULES_AND_BEST_PRACTICES.md completely
2. Following Section 9 (Auto-Generation Protocol), generate minimal valid versions of:
   - AI_CONTEXT_INDEX.md
   - TODO.md
   - SESSION_NOTES.md
   - SESSION_BUFFER.md (for this active session)
3. If Python/Code Interpreter is available:
   - Use Method 2 (Section 1.2) to create governance_files.zip
   - Include all 4 files in the zip
4. If Python unavailable:
   - Output each file as markdown code blocks with clear headers
5. Explain:
   - Which files were created
   - Where to put them (project root)
   - How to commit them
   - What to upload in the next session

If anything is fundamentally unclear, apply Section 6.1 (ask for clarification). Otherwise, proceed automatically.
```

**Step 2:** Paste the prompt into ChatGPT

**Step 3:** Upload `AI_RULES_AND_BEST_PRACTICES.md` (from this repo)

**Step 4:** Send the message

**Step 5:** ChatGPT will:
- Generate 4 governance files
- Create `governance_files.zip` for download (if Code Interpreter enabled)
- OR output files as code blocks to copy/paste

**Step 6:** Download the zip (or copy each file) and save to your project root:
```
your-project/
├── AI_RULES_AND_BEST_PRACTICES.md  (you already have this)
├── AI_CONTEXT_INDEX.md              (new - generated by AI)
├── TODO.md                          (new - generated by AI)
├── SESSION_NOTES.md                 (new - generated by AI)
└── SESSION_BUFFER.md                (new - generated by AI)
```

**Step 7:** Commit to git:
```bash
git add AI_CONTEXT_INDEX.md TODO.md SESSION_NOTES.md SESSION_BUFFER.md
git commit -m "[AI] Initialize governance framework"
git push
```

**Done!** Your project now has AI governance. 🎉

---

### Option 2: Using VS Code with GitHub Copilot

**Step 1:** Copy `AI_RULES_AND_BEST_PRACTICES.md` to your project root

**Step 2:** In Copilot Chat, type:
```
@workspace Read AI_RULES_AND_BEST_PRACTICES.md and generate missing governance files
```

**Step 3:** Copilot will create the files directly in your file system

**Step 4:** Commit the new files

**Done!** Much simpler in IDEs since they have file system access.

## 🔄 Continuing an Existing Project

### For Browser/Mobile Users (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)

**Step 1:** Copy this prompt:

```
Continuing a governed project.

Uploading current governance files:
- AI_RULES_AND_BEST_PRACTICES.md (operating system)
- AI_CONTEXT_INDEX.md
- TODO.md
- SESSION_NOTES.md
- SESSION_BUFFER.md (if exists from last session)

Steps:

1. **Validate files (Section 1.2 step 2):**
   - Confirm all expected files present
   - Check markdown structure
   - Warn if SESSION_NOTES.md > 7 days old
   - Report any corruption

2. **Reconstruct context:**
   - Review last session's work
   - Check current TODO items
   - Understand project state

3. **Report status:**
   - Summary of current state
   - Pending tasks
   - Any validation warnings

4. **Ask:** What should we work on today?
```

**Step 2:** Paste the prompt into your chat

**Step 3:** Upload ALL governance files:
- AI_RULES_AND_BEST_PRACTICES.md
- AI_CONTEXT_INDEX.md
- TODO.md
- SESSION_NOTES.md
- SESSION_BUFFER.md (if you have it)

**Step 4:** Send the message

**Step 5:** The AI will:
- Validate your files (check for corruption, staleness)
- Reconstruct your project context
- Summarize recent work and pending tasks
- Ask what to work on

**Step 6:** Tell the AI what you want to work on, and proceed normally

---

### For IDE Users (VS Code, etc.)

Just open your project. GitHub Copilot/Cursor will automatically read the governance files in your workspace. No manual upload needed.

## 📦 Closing a Session (Save Your Progress)

When you're done working and want to save your progress:

**Step 1:** Copy this prompt:

```
Close this session per governance rules (Section 8.2).

Steps:

1. Update governance files:
   - Add new session entry to SESSION_NOTES.md (date, summary, files touched, risks)
   - Update TODO.md (mark completed tasks, add follow-ups)
   - Update AI_CONTEXT_INDEX.md (if structure changed)
   - Collapse SESSION_BUFFER.md into SESSION_NOTES.md (Section 8.2 step 4)

2. Export updated files:
   - If Python available: Create governance_files.zip with all updated files
   - If Python unavailable: Output each file as markdown code blocks

3. Provide instructions:
   - Which files were updated
   - How to commit them (suggest git commands)
   - What to upload next session
```

**Step 2:** Send the prompt

**Step 3:** The AI will:
- Update SESSION_NOTES.md with what you did this session
- Update TODO.md with completed/new tasks
- Collapse SESSION_BUFFER.md into permanent notes
- Export a zip file (or code blocks) with updated files

**Step 4:** Download and save the updated files to your project

**Step 5:** Commit the changes:
```bash
git add AI_CONTEXT_INDEX.md TODO.md SESSION_NOTES.md SESSION_BUFFER.md
git commit -m "[AI] Session 2 - Updated feature X"
git push
```

**Done!** Your progress is saved and ready for next session.

## 📱 Mobile Tips

Working from your phone? No problem:

1. **GitHub Mobile App:** View/download governance files from your repo
2. **ChatGPT/Claude App:** Upload files and get downloadable artifacts
3. **File Management:** Use Files app (iOS) or Downloads (Android) to save artifacts
4. **Git Commit:** Use Working Copy (iOS) or GitHub mobile app to commit changes

The framework works identically on mobile, desktop, and tablets.

## 🔍 What Each File Does

### AI_RULES_AND_BEST_PRACTICES.md
**The "Operating System"** - Contains all rules AI agents must follow. Upload this first, always. It tells the AI how to behave, what to generate, and how to maintain state.

### AI_CONTEXT_INDEX.md
**The "Project Map"** - Lists what files exist, where they are, what they do. When the AI reads this, it understands your project structure without reading every file.

### TODO.md
**The "Task List"** - Tracks what needs to be done, what's in progress, what's complete. The AI checks this at session start and updates it at session end.

### SESSION_NOTES.md
**The "Work Log"** - Chronological record of what happened each session. Date, time, files changed, decisions made. This is your project's memory.

### SESSION_BUFFER.md
**The "Scratch Paper"** - Temporary working notes during long sessions. At session end, important stuff moves to SESSION_NOTES.md, everything else is discarded.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I need to upload all files every time?**  
A: For browser/mobile users, yes. For IDE users, no (files are already in your workspace).

**Q: What if I forget a file?**  
A: The AI will warn you during validation (Section 1.2 step 2) and suggest regenerating missing files.

**Q: Can I edit these files manually?**  
A: Yes! They're just markdown. Edit TODO.md, SESSION_NOTES.md, etc. as needed. The AI will read your changes.

**Q: What if SESSION_NOTES.md gets huge?**  
A: Archive old sessions to `/archive/YYYY-MM-DD/` per Section 9.5. Keep only recent sessions in the main file.

**Q: Does this work with Claude? Gemini? Other LLMs?**  
A: Yes! The framework is LLM-agnostic. Same files, same prompts, same workflow across all platforms.

**Q: Do I need ChatGPT Plus/Pro?**  
A: Not required, but recommended. Code Interpreter (Plus/Pro) enables zip downloads. Free tier requires copy/paste.

**Q: Can I use this on team projects?**  
A: Yes! Commit governance files to your shared repo. Every team member gets consistent AI behavior.

## 🎓 Learning Path

**Week 1:** Bootstrap a small project, do 2-3 sessions, get comfortable with the workflow

**Week 2:** Try longer sessions, use SESSION_BUFFER.md for draft work, practice session close

**Week 3:** Test on mobile, try different LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini), compare experiences

**Week 4:** Use in real work projects, customize AI_CONTEXT_INDEX.md for your codebase

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"AI isn't following the rules"**  
→ Make sure you uploaded AI_RULES_AND_BEST_PRACTICES.md first  
→ Use the exact bootstrap/continuation prompts from this guide  
→ Check that files aren't corrupted (validation step will catch this)

**"Files are outdated/stale"**  
→ AI will warn you if SESSION_NOTES.md > 7 days old  
→ Upload fresh copies from your git repo  
→ Run validation step from continuation prompt

**"Zip download not working"**  
→ You might be on ChatGPT Free (no Code Interpreter)  
→ Upgrade to Plus/Pro, or use copy/paste fallback (Method 3)  
→ Claude users: Try Method 1 (Artifacts) instead

**"Too many files to upload on mobile"**  
→ Use GitHub mobile app to sync files first  
→ Consider IDE on desktop for complex work  
→ Mobile works best for short sessions with few file changes
